# Hello!

Thanks for visiting my repository. I am really so happy that you've came here for me in the big internet world. This page contains a source code makes up my personal website https://junie.land/.




## The structure of the repository

* The repository `main` contains the final version of the source code. The site is made with React and boilerplated by create-react-app.
* The repository `gh-pages` contains the emitted source code after react build, and is being hosted with a help of github pages.
* All other repository is made for developing, testing, bug-fixing or just for fun.



## To mimic the website

* Clone the repository in your computer.

`git clone https://github.com/junis3/junis3.github.io.git`

* Install the dependency packages.

`cd junis3.github.io/`

`yarn`

* Open the server in your computer locally.

`yarn start`

* If you want to deploy the project, first upload the code to a new github pages repository and do

`yarn build`

`yarn deploy`

to get a new branch `gh-pages`. Setting the branch to be hosted in the bottom of setting page of the repository makes the code visible public on web.
